SLOs and SLIs are key SRE/platform engineering concepts that describe

These concepts tend be far away from software developers, which tend to mostly focus on writing code, and left
to dealt with by the SRE/platform teams within a company.



SLO are things that should be defined by team together with the stakeholders


**Slotalk** aims to bridge the gap between SRE/platform teams and development teams by:
* Allowing the development teams to be more involved with the definition and maintenance of the SLOs for the services they develop.
* Allowing the SREs/platform teams to not be solely responsible for the maintenance of SLOs/SLIs and metrics.
